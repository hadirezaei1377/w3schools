OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming :

Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.

Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

OOP is faster and easier to execute
OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time
Tip: The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.

Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.

Look at the following illustration to see the difference between class and objects:
                        class                                   objects 

                        fruit                                   apple
                                                                banana 
                                                                ...
                                                                related to this class
                        
                        car                                     Volvo
                                                                Audi
                                                                ...
                                                                
                                                            
So, a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.
When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and functions from the class.
C++ is an object-oriented programming language, 
Everything in C++ is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.

Attributes and methods are basically variables and functions that belongs to the class. These are often referred to as "class members".

To create a class, use the class keyword:

Example
Create a class called "MyClass":

class MyClass {       // The class
  public:             // Access specifier
    int myNum;        // Attribute (int variable)
    string myString;  // Attribute (string variable)
};

The class keyword is used to create a class called MyClass.
The public keyword is an access specifier, which specifies that members (attributes and methods) of the class are accessible from outside the class. 
Inside the class, there is an integer variable myNum and a string variable myString. When variables are declared within a class, they are called attributes.
At last, end the class definition with a semicolon ;.

In C++, an object is created from a class. We have already created the class named MyClass, so now we can use this to create objects.

To create an object of MyClass, specify the class name, followed by the object name.
To access the class attributes (myNum and myString), use the dot syntax (.) on the object:

Example
Create an object called "myObj" and access the attributes:

class MyClass {       // The class
  public:             // Access specifier
    int myNum;        // Attribute (int variable)
    string myString;  // Attribute (string variable)
};

int main() {
  MyClass myObj;  // Create an object of MyClass

  // Access attributes and set values
  myObj.myNum = 15; 
  myObj.myString = "Some text";

  // Print attribute values
  cout << myObj.myNum << "\n";
  cout << myObj.myString;
  return 0;
}

Class Methods
Methods are functions that belongs to the class.
There are two ways to define functions that belongs to a class:

Inside class definition
Outside class definition

In the following example, we define a function inside the class, and we name it "myMethod".

Note: You access methods just like you access attributes; by creating an object of the class and using the dot syntax (.):

class MyClass {        
  public:              // Access specifier
    void myMethod() {  // Method/function defined inside the class
      cout << "Hello World!";
    }
};

int main() {
  MyClass myObj;     // Create an object of MyClass
  myObj.myMethod();  // Call the method
  return 0;
}
To define a function outside the class definition, you have to declare it inside the class and then define it outside of the class. This is done by specifiying the name of the class, followed the scope resolution :: operator, followed by the name of the function:

Outside Example
class MyClass {        
  public:              // Access specifier
    void myMethod();   // Method/function declaration
};

// Method/function definition outside the class
void MyClass::myMethod() {
  cout << "Hello World!";
}

int main() {
  MyClass myObj;     // Create an object of MyClass
  myObj.myMethod();  // Call the method
  return 0;
}

 Example
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Car {
  public:
    int speed(int maxSpeed);
};

int Car::speed(int maxSpeed) {
  return maxSpeed;
}

int main() {
  Car myObj; // Create an object of Car
  cout << myObj.speed(200); // Call the method with an argument
  return 0;
}


Constructors
A constructor in C++ is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created.

To create a constructor, use the same name as the class, followed by parentheses ():

Example
class MyClass {     
  public:           // Access specifier
    MyClass() {     // Constructor
      cout << "Hello World!";
    }
};

int main() {
  MyClass myObj;    // Create an object of MyClass (this will call the constructor)
  return 0;
}
Note: The constructor has the same name as the class, it is always public, and it does not have any return value.

Constructors can also take parameters (just like regular functions), which can be useful for setting initial values for attributes.

The following class have brand, model and year attributes, and a constructor with different parameters. Inside the constructor we set the attributes equal to the constructor parameters (brand=x, etc). When we call the constructor (by creating an object of the class), we pass parameters to the constructor, which will set the value of the corresponding attributes to the same:

Example
class Car {        // The class
  public:          // Access specifier
    string brand;  // Attribute
    string model;  // Attribute
    int year;      // Attribute
    Car(string x, string y, int z) { // Constructor with parameters
      brand = x;
      model = y;
      year  =  z;
    }
};

int main() {
  // Create Car objects and call the constructor with different values
  Car carObj1("BMW", "X5", 1999);
  Car carObj2("Ford", "Mustang", 1969);

  // Print values
  cout << carObj1.brand << " " << carObj1.model << " " << carObj1.year << "\n";
  cout << carObj2.brand << " " << carObj2.model << " " << carObj2.year << "\n";
  return 0;
}
Just like functions, constructors can also be defined outside the class. First, declare the constructor inside the class, and then define it outside of the class by specifying the name of the class, followed by the scope resolution :: operator, followed by the name of the constructor (which is the same as the class):

Example
class Car {        // The class
  public:          // Access specifier
    string brand;  // Attribute
    string model;  // Attribute
    int year;      // Attribute
    Car(string x, string y, int z); // Constructor declaration
};

// Constructor definition outside the class
Car::Car(string x, string y, int z) {
  brand = x;
  model = y;
  year = z;
}

int main() {
  // Create Car objects and call the constructor with different values
  Car carObj1("BMW", "X5", 1999);
  Car carObj2("Ford", "Mustang", 1969);

  // Print values
  cout << carObj1.brand << " " << carObj1.model << " " << carObj1.year << "\n";
  cout << carObj2.brand << " " << carObj2.model << " " << carObj2.year << "\n";
  return 0;
}


class MyClass {  // The class
  public:        // Access specifier
    // class members goes here
};
The public keyword is an access specifier. Access specifiers define how the members (attributes and methods) of a class can be accessed. In the example above, the members are public - which means that they can be accessed and modified from outside the code.

In C++, there are three access specifiers:

public - members are accessible from outside the class
private - members cannot be accessed (or viewed) from outside the class
protected - members cannot be accessed from outside the class, however, they can be accessed in inherited classes. 
In the following example, we demonstrate the differences between public and private members:

Example
class MyClass {
  public:    // Public access specifier
    int x;   // Public attribute
  private:   // Private access specifier
    int y;   // Private attribute
};

int main() {
  MyClass myObj;
  myObj.x = 25;  // Allowed (public)
  myObj.y = 50;  // Not allowed (private)
  return 0;
}
If you try to access a private member, an error occurs:

error: y is private
Note: It is possible to access private members of a class using a public method inside the same class.

Tip: It is considered good practice to declare your class attributes as private (as often as you can). This will reduce the possibility of yourself (or others) to mess up the code. This is also the main ingredient of the Encapsulation concept.

Note: By default, all members of a class are private if you don't specify an access specifier:

Example
class MyClass {
  int x;   // Private attribute
  int y;   // Private attribute
};

Encapsulation
The meaning of Encapsulation, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. To achieve this, you must declare class variables/attributes as private (cannot be accessed from outside the class). If you want others to read or modify the value of a private member, you can provide public get and set methods.

To access a private attribute, use public "get" and "set" methods:

Example
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Employee {
  private:
    // Private attribute
    int salary;

  public:
    // Setter
    void setSalary(int s) {
      salary = s;
    }
    // Getter
    int getSalary() {
      return salary;
    }
};

int main() {
  Employee myObj;
  myObj.setSalary(50000);
  cout << myObj.getSalary();
  return 0;
}

The salary attribute is private, which have restricted access.
The public setSalary() method takes a parameter (s) and assigns it to the salary attribute (salary = s).
The public getSalary() method returns the value of the private salary attribute.
Inside main(), we create an object of the Employee class. Now we can use the setSalary() method to set the value of the private attribute to 50000. Then we call the getSalary() method on the object to return the value.

Why Encapsulation?
It is considered good practice to declare your class attributes as private (as often as you can). Encapsulation ensures better control of your data, because you (or others) can change one part of the code without affecting other parts
Increased security of data

Inheritance
In C++, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:

derived class (child) - the class that inherits from another class
base class (parent) - the class being inherited from

In the example below, the Car class (child) inherits the attributes and methods from the Vehicle class (parent):

Example
// Base class
class Vehicle {
  public:
    string brand = "Ford";
    void honk() {
      cout << "Tuut, tuut! \n" ;
    }
};

// Derived class
class Car: public Vehicle {
  public:
    string model = "Mustang";
};

int main() {
  Car myCar;
  myCar.honk();
  cout << myCar.brand + " " + myCar.model;
  return 0;
}
Why And When To Use "Inheritance"?
- It is useful for code reusability: reuse attributes and methods of an existing class when you create a new class.

Multilevel Inheritance
A class can also be derived from one class, which is already derived from another class.

In the following example, MyGrandChild is derived from class MyChild (which is derived from MyClass).

Example
// Base class (parent)
class MyClass {
  public:
    void myFunction() {
      cout << "Some content in parent class." ;
    }
};

// Derived class (child)
class MyChild: public MyClass {
};

// Derived class (grandchild)
class MyGrandChild: public MyChild {
};

int main() {
  MyGrandChild myObj;
  myObj.myFunction();
  return 0;
}


Access Specifiers
You learned from the Access Specifiers chapter that there are three specifiers available in C++. Until now, we have only used public (members of a class are accessible from outside the class) and private (members can only be accessed within the class). The third specifier, protected, is similar to private, but it can also be accessed in the inherited class:

Example
// Base class
class Employee {
  protected: // Protected access specifier
    int salary;
};

// Derived class
class Programmer: public Employee {
  public:
    int bonus;
    void setSalary(int s) {
      salary = s;
    }
    int getSalary() {
      return salary;
    }
};

int main() {
  Programmer myObj;
  myObj.setSalary(50000);
  myObj.bonus = 15000;
  cout << "Salary: " << myObj.getSalary() << "\n";
  cout << "Bonus: " << myObj.bonus << "\n";
  return 0;
}

Polymorphism
Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.
Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.

For example, think of a base class called Animal that has a method called animalSound(). Derived classes of Animals could be Pigs, Cats, Dogs, Birds - And they also have their own implementation of an animal sound (the pig oinks, and the cat meows, etc.):

Example
// Base class
class Animal {
  public:
    void animalSound() {
      cout << "The animal makes a sound \n";
    }
};

// Derived class
class Pig : public Animal {
  public:
    void animalSound() {
      cout << "The pig says: wee wee \n";
    }
};

// Derived class
class Dog : public Animal {
  public:
    void animalSound() {
      cout << "The dog says: bow wow \n";
    }
};


Now we can create Pig and Dog objects and override the animalSound() method:

Example
// Base class
class Animal {
  public:
    void animalSound() {
      cout << "The animal makes a sound \n";
    }
};

// Derived class
class Pig : public Animal {
  public:
    void animalSound() {
      cout << "The pig says: wee wee \n";
    }
};

// Derived class
class Dog : public Animal {
  public:
    void animalSound() {
      cout << "The dog says: bow wow \n";
    }
};

int main() {
  Animal myAnimal;
  Pig myPig;
  Dog myDog;

  myAnimal.animalSound();
  myPig.animalSound();
  myDog.animalSound();
  return 0;
}

The   library allows us to work with files.

To use the fstream library, include both the standard <iostream> AND the <fstream> header file:

Example
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
There are three classes included in the fstream library, which are used to create, write or read files:

Class	     Description
ofstream	 Creates and writes to files
ifstream	 Reads from files

fstream	A combination of ofstream and ifstream: creates, reads, and writes to files
Create and Write To a File
To create a file, use either the ofstream or fstream class, and specify the name of the file.

To write to the file, use the insertion operator (<<).

Example
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  // Create and open a text file
  ofstream MyFile("filename.txt");

  // Write to the file
  MyFile << "Files can be tricky, but it is fun enough!";

  // Close the file
  MyFile.close();
}
Why do we close the file?
It is considered good practice, and it can clean up unnecessary memory space.

Read a File
To read from a file, use either the ifstream or fstream class, and the name of the file.

Note that we also use a while loop together with the getline() function (which belongs to the ifstream class) to read the file line by line, and to print the content of the file:

Example
// Create a text string, which is used to output the text file
string myText;

// Read from the text file
ifstream MyReadFile("filename.txt");

// Use a while loop together with the getline() function to read the file line by line
while (getline (MyReadFile, myText)) {
  // Output the text from the file
  cout << myText;
}

// Close the file
MyReadFile.close();


C++ Exceptions
When executing C++ code, different errors can occur: coding errors made by the programmer, errors due to wrong input, or other unforeseeable things.
